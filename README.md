# Document Chatbot

This project is a recreation of the [original version](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/436613). Feel free to visit the original link to learn more about the inspiration behind this document chatbot.

## Overview

The Document Chatbot is designed to learn from a given PDF and engage in conversations with users based on the knowledge it acquires. Keep in mind that the results may not always be accurate.

## How It Works

1. **Provide a PDF:** Feed the chatbot with a PDF document of your choice. The bot will learn from the contents of the document to respond to queries.

2. **Run the Program:** Simply run the provided notebook, specifying the path to your PDF file in the `PyPDFLoader`. A detailed explanation of the code is available within the notebook in the form of comments.

3. **Engage in Conversations:** Once the bot has processed the PDF, you can start chatting with it to ask queries. Be aware that the accuracy of the results may vary.

## Running the Program

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

- Open the provided notebook.
- Specify the path to your PDF in the `PyPDFLoader` section.
- Run the cells sequentially.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different PDFs to see how the chatbot performs.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that the accuracy of the chatbot's responses depends on the content and complexity of the provided PDF. Results may be inaccurate.

Happy chatting with your Document Chatbot!
